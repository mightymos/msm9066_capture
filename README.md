# Sonoff RF Bridge R2 v2.2
This is a capture of the MSM9066 programmer ($30 USD) flashing a blink program to the OBS38S003 8051 based micrcocontroller.  
This microcontroller is present in a newer generation of the Sonoff RF Bridge.  

With these traces flashing can hopefully being implemented with additional and less expensive devices.  
Ideally flashing would be supported by Tasmota itself once a custom firmware is developed.  
Such a custom firmware would provide control of the bridge radio decoding while avoiding the need for hardware modification.
